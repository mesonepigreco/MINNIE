 * This file is used to test the neural network generated with the

 * Please, look at the comments in that file to see how to generate
 * a simple neural network.
 *
 * This file picks an atom in a given configuration, and moves it for
 * some steps by a small amount (printed in standard output).
 * It will print the total energy and the force along the direction
 * in which it is moved. You can use it to test the neural network.

 * Run this example with:
 *
 * >>> ../../bin/test_nn_prediction.exe test_twosym.cfg
